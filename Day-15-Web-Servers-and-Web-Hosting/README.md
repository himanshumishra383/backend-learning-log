# Day 15 – Web Servers and Web Hosting

## Why this topic?
Web server and web hosting are often confused.
They are not the same.

- Web server = how HTTP traffic is handled
- Hosting = where and how the system runs

Understanding this separation is critical for real backend architecture.

## Core idea
Web server is the **front door**.
Hosting is the **building**.

You can change one without rewriting the other.

## What you’ll learn
- What a web server actually does
- What hosting really means
- Types of hosting (shared, VPS, dedicated, cloud)
- Why web servers exist at all
- Static vs dynamic responsibility
- Architectural separation of concerns
