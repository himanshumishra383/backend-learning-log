# Day 17 – IP: TCP/IP, UDP & 3-Way Handshake

## Why this matters
TCP/IP is not a single protocol.
It’s a disciplined stack where each layer refuses to do more than its job.

Understanding TCP, UDP, and the 3-way handshake explains:
- Why some systems feel slow but safe
- Why others are fast but imperfect
- Why reliability always has a cost

## What you’ll learn
- TCP vs UDP (real distinction)
- Why TCP keeps state
- Why UDP avoids promises
- The TCP 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
- Architectural cost of reliability

See `NOTES.md` for deep explanation.
