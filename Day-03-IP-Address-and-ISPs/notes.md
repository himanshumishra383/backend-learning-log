## IP Address & ISPs

### What is an IP Address?
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to a device on a network.
It works like a digital home address that allows data to be sent and received.

### Layman Example
- Your phone opens YouTube
- YouTube server needs to know where to send data back
- Your IP address tells: “Send it here”

### Key Functions
- Identification: Uniquely identifies a device on a network
- Location: Helps route data to the correct destination

### IP Versions
- IPv4: 32-bit address (e.g. 192.168.1.1), limited address space
- IPv6: 128-bit address (e.g. 2001:db8::1), created to handle huge growth

### Types of IP Addresses
- Public IP: Visible on the internet, assigned to router
- Private IP: Used inside local networks (home WiFi)
- Static IP: Fixed IP, used for servers
- Dynamic IP: Changes over time, assigned by DHCP

### How IP Works (Flow)
1. Device sends request with its IP
2. Server processes request
3. Response is sent back to the same IP
