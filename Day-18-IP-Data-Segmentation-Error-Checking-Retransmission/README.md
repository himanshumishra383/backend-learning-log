# Day 18 – IP: Data Segmentation, Error Checking & Retransmission

## Why this matters
The internet is unreliable by default.
Packets are lost, duplicated, delayed, or corrupted.

TCP exists to make chaos look orderly.

These mechanisms are not features.
They are survival strategies.

## What you’ll learn
- Why large data is segmented
- How sequence numbers keep order
- How TCP detects corruption
- Why acknowledgements matter
- How retransmission actually works
- Flow control vs congestion control
- Why UDP skips all of this

See `NOTES.md` for detailed explanation.
