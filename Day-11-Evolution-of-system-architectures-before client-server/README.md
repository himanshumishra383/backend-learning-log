# Day 11 – Client–Server Architecture (Earlier Systems)

## Topic
Evolution of system architectures before modern client–server became standard.

## Why this matters
- Explains why current architectures exist
- Shows limits of vertical scaling
- Builds intuition for distributed systems

## What I covered
- Standalone / Monolithic systems
- Mainframe + Dumb terminals
- File server architecture
- Early distributed (peer-to-peer-ish) systems
- Key trade-offs and failures

## Outcome
✔ Clear historical context behind modern client–server systems
