# Day 19 – IP: Reliability vs Speed

## Core idea
Reliability and speed are not opposites.
They are competing priorities.

You never get both for free.
You choose where you pay: time, bandwidth, or complexity.

## What this note covers
- What reliability actually means
- What speed actually means
- Why you can’t maximize both
- TCP vs UDP trade-off
- Who handles failure (protocol vs application)
- Real-world examples
- Modern hybrid approaches (QUIC, HTTP/3)
