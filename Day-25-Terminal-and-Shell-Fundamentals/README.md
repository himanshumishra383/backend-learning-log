# Day-25 – The Terminal: Where Real Control Lives

## Overview
The terminal (CLI) is a text-based interface that gives direct access to the operating system.
Behind every GUI action is a command—the terminal exposes that layer.

## Why Developers Use It
- Running servers and builds
- Installing dependencies
- Managing Git
- Debugging processes
- Accessing remote machines
- Writing automation scripts

## Key Idea
The terminal is not about individual commands.
It’s about composing them to build powerful workflows.

## Final Note
GUIs are comfortable.
The terminal is honest.

If you want speed, precision, and real control—learn the terminal.
