# Day-26 – Version Control: Git & GitHub

## Overview
Version control is the safety net of modern software.
It tracks changes, enables collaboration, and lets you recover from mistakes instantly.

## Key Ideas
- Git tracks snapshots, not files
- Distributed model enables offline work
- Branching enables safe experimentation
- GitHub adds collaboration and automation

## Why It Matters
Without version control, every change is a risk.
With it, change becomes controlled and reversible.

## Final Thought
Version control is not a tool choice.
It’s infrastructure.
