# Day-23 – WebRTC – Real-Time Communication (No Middleman)

## What is WebRTC?
WebRTC enables real-time:
- Video calls
- Voice chats
- Screen sharing

Directly inside the browser, without installing anything.

That’s not magic. That’s WebRTC.

---

## Why WebRTC Exists
Traditional client-server communication:
- Adds latency
- Increases server load
- Breaks real-time experience

WebRTC allows:
- Direct peer-to-peer communication
- Ultra-low latency
- Encrypted media by default

---

## Key Characteristics
- Peer-to-peer by design
- Real-time audio, video, and data
- Encrypted end-to-end
- Browser-native support

---

## Where WebRTC Is Used
- Video conferencing apps
- Voice calling platforms
- Screen sharing tools
- Online interviews
- Live collaboration software

If milliseconds matter, WebRTC is the correct choice.

---

## Limitations
WebRTC is not ideal for:
- Large broadcasts
- Massive audiences
- Centralized media control

For those, combine with:
- Streaming protocols
- SFU / MCU media servers

---

## WebRTC vs WebSocket
- WebSocket → best for real-time messaging
- WebRTC → best for real-time presence

Choose based on the problem, not hype.

---

## Bottom Line
WebRTC removes the middleman from real-time communication.

Low latency.
High complexity.
Maximum control.

Use it intentionally.
