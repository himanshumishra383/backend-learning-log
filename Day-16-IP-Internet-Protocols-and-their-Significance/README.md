# Day 16 – IP: Internet Protocols & Their Significance

## Why this topic?
The internet is not a place.
It’s an agreement.

Protocols are the only reason billions of independent machines
can talk without coordination, trust, or central control.

## Core idea
Protocols are shared contracts.
They turn chaos into predictable behavior.

Without protocols:
- No scale
- No reliability
- No internet

## What you’ll learn
- What a protocol really is
- Why the internet *needs* protocols
- What problems protocols solve
- Application vs transport vs network responsibility
- Why IP is intentionally unreliable
- TCP vs UDP (behavioral tradeoffs)
- The layered protocol mental model

See `NOTES.md` for deep understanding.
